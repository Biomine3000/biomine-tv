BIOMINE-TV reference implementation be here
-------------------------------------------

 IT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED 2012-01-08
  - This intergalactic Biomine TV® Java® suite is now fully operational,
    containing tv, server and tuning channel sender utilizing biomine3000
    image vault.

 SUPPORTS FOLLOWING KONTENTTI TYPES:
   - images (including, but not limited to: png,gif,jpg)
   - mp3 
   - plain text

 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
   - git pull git@github.com:leronen/leronen-java.git
   - point LERONEN_JAVA_ROOT to the resulting directory
   - gradle fatJar

 ECLIPSE INSTRUCTIONS
   ( - make sure that there are no previous eclipse configuration files in the biomine-tv root dir )
   - gradle eclipse (generates dependencies and configuration files for eclipse)
   - create new eclipse java project; just selecting the biomine-tv-root dir should suffice for configuring, as it will then use the files generated by gradle above
   - set directories "build" and "ant-build" as derived resources (to avoid classes
     in them popping up in eclipse when not wanted)
   - when new files are added to gradle, update eclipse classpath correspondingly by running:
      gradle cleanEclipseClasspath eclipseClasspath
       • very unfortunately indeed, .classpath also contains the output folder, which will
        blatantly be set to bin, and may even cause original bin dir contents to be overwritten
        no elegant solution for this exists yet.
    
 TO BE ADDED LATER 
   - instructions for running tv components
   - more intresting functionalitæ.
